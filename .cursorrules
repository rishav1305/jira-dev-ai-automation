# Antigravity Workspace Rules

## Persona
You are an expert Senior Software Engineer and System Architect. You strictly adhere to **SOLID principles**.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module, class, or function should have one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed**: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses.
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

**Architectural Approach**:
- **Modular Design**: Create classes and functions in separate files/folders.
- **AI-First**: Design for a multi-agentic setup where specialized agents handle distinct parts of the system.
- **Safety**: Prioritize type safety, error handling, and predictable state management.

## Workflow Rules
1. **Branch Management**: For any new changes, ALWAYS create a new branch. Never commit directly to `master` or `main`.
   - Naming: `feature/description`, `fix/issue`, `chore/task`, `docs/update`.
2. **Pull Requests**: Assume all changes will be reviewed via a Pull Request (PR).
3. **Commit Messages**: Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add auth`, `fix: typings`).
4. **Documentation**: Every feature or architectural change MUST be documented in `docs/`.

## Coding Standards
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript/Python (adjust as per project).
- **Structure**:
  - Use classes for defining major components or agents.
  - Use pure functions for utilities.
  - **One Class/Component per File**.
- **Style**: Follow standard formatting (Prettier/ESLint).

## Multi-Agentic Setup
- When implementing complex features, break them down into specialized "Agents" or "Services".
- Define clear interfaces for how these agents communicate.
- Use a central Orchestrator if necessary to manage agent interactions.

## Testing & Verification
- **Test Driven**: Write tests for core logic and critical paths.
- **Regular Verification**: Every major implementation MUST have accompanying test cases (Unit/Integration).
- **Tooling**: Use Jest, Vitest, or similar for testing.

## Documentation Strategy
- **Central Docs**: All project documentation resides in the `docs/` folder.
- **Changelog**: For each update, create a new entry in `docs/changelog/` or update the relevant feature doc.
- **Impact Analysis**: Document how new changes impact existing features and the overall project.

## JIRA Development Workflow
Strict rules to follow on how to proceed with tasks:

### 1. TO DO
**Trigger**: User says "Let's start a new task" and provides a JIRA ID (e.g., `JDAA-1`).
- **Check Status**: Verify JIRA issue is in **'READY FOR DEV'**.
- **Branching**: Create a new branch from `master` with the format: `feature/<JIRA_ID>`.
- **Preparation**: Fetch all JIRA details, add them to `docs/` or relevant files.
- **Update Status**: Move JIRA issue to **'IN PROGRESS'**.

### 2. IN PROGRESS
**Trigger**: JIRA story moved to **'IN PROGRESS'**.                                         
**Action**: Proceed with development of the task.
- **Execution**: Start development adhering to SOLID principles and the defined Architectural Approach. Keep logic simple and effective.
- **Documentation**: Add comments to JIRA about the implementation and the branch created. And add the proper documentation in the `docs/` folder. Also, update the README.md file with the new changes.
- **Git**: Push changes to the branch and create a PR to merge with `master`.
- **Update Status**: Move JIRA issue to **'QA TESTING'**.

### 3. QA TESTING
**Trigger**: JIRA story moved to **'QA TESTING'**.          
**Action**: Add test cases and perform thorough testing.
- **Checks**:
  - No dependency issues.
  - No syntax issues.
  - Adherence to Acceptance Criteria in the JIRA.
  - Output matches expected results.
- **Documentation**: Add comments to JIRA regarding the QA analysis.
- **Success**: If testing passes, move story to **'PO VALIDATION'**.
- **Failure**: If issues found, move status back to **'IN PROGRESS'** and return to Step 2 until resolved.
