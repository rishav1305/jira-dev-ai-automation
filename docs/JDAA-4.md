# JDAA-4: Bugs in JIRA MCP Server

## Overview
The goal of this task is to identify and fix bugs in the JIRA MCP server implementation.

## Context
The MCP server (`src/mcp_server.py`) allows AI agents to interact with JIRA.
Previous work in `feature/CDAA-3-mcp-server` introduced the server but it has reported bugs.

## Objectives
1.  Verify the current implementation of `src/mcp_server.py`.
2.  Identify runtime errors or logical flaws.
3.  Fix the issues to ensure stable operation.
